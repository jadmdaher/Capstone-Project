Requirements:
1. Android Studio Ladybug version 2024.2.2 or later.
2.1. Android device emulator with minimum Android SDK version = 28. The target SDK version is 35.
2.2. If you do not have or cannot download/run an Android emulator on your computer, you can use a physical Android device (not Huawei) and connect it by cable.
2.3. If you choose to use a physical Android device you need to enable developer options and enable USB debugging (enabling developer options may differ on each device so please check how to do so on the device you choose to use).

To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Extract the project files from the downloaded ZIP folder.
2. Open the project, after extracting the files, on Android Studio.
3. The IDE might take some time before it is ready to run the app to sync Gradle files and download dependencies.
4. No additional setup should be required to establish a database connection or connect to the Google Maps API, as all the keys and dependencies that need to be set up are already in their respective files. However, if you face any issue regarding the usage of Google Maps API or connecting to Firebase (database connection) please let me know.
5. It is best to run the app on two devices simultaneously, where on one device login as a driver and on the other as a passenger. You can have an emulator running with a physical device, two emulators running, or two physical devices (they all work together).

Disclosure: If you face any difficulties running the project on your environment, please let me know and I will do my best to help you complete the set up. However, this manual should cover everything you need.
